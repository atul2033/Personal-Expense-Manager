# 🚀 SpendWise

**SpendWise** — A minimalist, cross-platform Flutter app (showcase-ready) for tracking daily expenses.
This repository contains a clean, well-structured Flutter project scaffold suitable for GitHub.

> Note: Firebase integration uses placeholder configuration. Replace with your own keys if you want a working backend.

## What's included
- `lib/` with basic screens and widgets
- `pubspec.yaml` ready for Flutter (packages listed)
- Placeholder Firebase setup (no real keys)
- `README.md` and `LICENSE` (MIT)
- `.gitignore`

## How to use
1. Clone the repo.
2. Open in your editor (Android Studio / VS Code).
3. Run `flutter pub get` to fetch dependencies.
4. Replace Firebase placeholders in `lib/services/firebase_options.dart` if you plan to connect to Firebase.
